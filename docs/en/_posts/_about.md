Hello guys!

Welcome to [My Personal Website](/)!

There are useful codes from my daily experience and the internet, summaries of review materials from school and various intresting knowledge in my opinion. Below are requirements for myself:

1. Write down reusable and valuable codes from daily review and a short note for it.
2. Write down fancy algorithms and codes on a whim.
3. Write down codes and a short note for it during independent study.
4. Write down codes and a short note for it during trouble shooting.
5. Produce small tools and highly reusable codes actively to form personal code libraries.
6. Anyway, just write something if the above is not reached.

In the past, I did not develop a habit to record what I had learned. Now, I hope I can develop the habit by writing notes in [My Personal Website](/).
